# 🚀 PingToPass Nuxt - Worktree Development Plan

## Executive Summary

We've successfully organized the PingToPass Nuxt development into a parallel worktree strategy that will enable simultaneous development across multiple features, reducing overall development time by 30-50%.

## 📋 Worktree Organization

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Sequential - 1-2 days)
**Worktree**: `foundation`  
**Branch**: `feature/foundation-setup`  
**Location**: `/Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/foundation`

**Tasks**:
- Issue #7: Setup Local Development Environment
- Issue #18: Create and Configure Turso Databases with CLI

**Why Sequential**: These form the base that all other work depends on.

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (3-5 days)

#### Stream A: Database Layer
**Worktree**: `database-layer`  
**Branch**: `feature/database-layer`  
**Location**: `/Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/database-layer`

**Tasks** (Sequential within stream):
- Issue #8: Setup Drizzle ORM with Turso Database
- Issue #17: Migrate Database Queries to Drizzle ORM
- Issue #19: Implement Type-Safe Database Queries with Drizzle

**Focus**: All database operations, schema, and ORM configuration

#### Stream B: Testing Framework
**Worktree**: `testing-setup`  
**Branch**: `feature/testing-setup`  
**Location**: `/Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/testing-setup`

**Tasks**:
- Issue #9: Configure Testing Framework with Vitest and Playwright

**Focus**: Complete testing infrastructure, unit and E2E tests

#### Stream C: Cloudflare Deployment
**Worktree**: `cloudflare-deployment`  
**Branch**: `feature/cloudflare-deployment`  
**Location**: `/Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/cloudflare-deployment`

**Tasks** (Sequential within stream):
- Issue #16: Configure Cloudflare Workers Deployment
- Issue #20: Update Wrangler Configuration for Workers Deployment

**Focus**: Deployment pipeline, CI/CD, and production configuration

## 🎯 How to Use This Setup

### Starting Development

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation (Do this first!)**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/foundation
   claude
   # Work on issues #7 and #18
   ```

2. **Phase 2 - Parallel Development (After Phase 1)**
   
   Open 3 terminal tabs/windows and start Claude in each:
   
   **Tab 1 - Database Layer**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/database-layer
   claude
   # Work on issues #8, #17, #19
   ```
   
   **Tab 2 - Testing Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/testing-setup
   claude
   # Work on issue #9
   ```
   
   **Tab 3 - Cloudflare Deployment**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-worktrees/cloudflare-deployment
   claude
   # Work on issues #16, #20
   ```

### Merging Work

After completing work in each worktree:

```bash
# Navigate to main repository
cd /Users/bhunt/development/claude/entrepreneur/fastmongo/pingtopass-nuxt

# Merge in order (respecting dependencies)
git checkout main
git merge feature/foundation-setup
git merge feature/database-layer
git merge feature/testing-setup
git merge feature/cloudflare-deployment

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Cleanup

When all work is complete:

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
./scripts/cleanup-worktrees.sh
```

## 📊 Expected Benefits

### Time Savings
- **Sequential Approach**: 10-15 days
- **Parallel Worktree Approach**: 5-8 days
- **Time Saved**: 5-7 days (50% reduction)

### Quality Improvements
- **Isolated Development**: No conflicts between features
- **Focused Claude Sessions**: Each session specializes in one area
- **Better Testing**: Dedicated testing stream ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Clean Merges**: Dependency-aware merge order prevents issues

### Developer Experience
- **Multiple Claude Sessions**: Run 3+ Claude instances simultaneously
- **Clear Separation**: Each worktree has its own focus area
- **Easy Context Switching**: Jump between worktrees as needed
- **Progress Visibility**: GitHub issues track each worktree's progress

## 🔄 Automation Scripts

### Setup Worktrees
```bash
./scripts/setup-worktrees.sh
```
Creates all worktrees and branches automatically

### Cleanup Worktrees
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-worktrees.sh
```
Removes worktrees and merges completed work

## 📝 GitHub Integration

All issues have been:
- **Labeled** with their worktree assignment
- **Commented** with development instructions
- **Organized** into phases for clear execution order

## 🚦 Current Status

✅ **Worktrees Created**: All 4 worktrees are ready  
✅ **Branches Created**: All feature branches pushed to GitHub  
✅ **Issues Assigned**: All 7 issues labeled and documented  
✅ **Scripts Created**: Automation scripts ready to use  
✅ **Documentation Complete**: Strategy fully documented  

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 1**: Begin work in the foundation worktree
2. **Complete Foundation**: Setup local dev and Turso databases
3. **Launch Phase 2**: Start 3 parallel Claude sessions
4. **Monitor Progress**: Check GitHub issues for updates
5. **Merge & Deploy**: Follow the merge strategy once complete
